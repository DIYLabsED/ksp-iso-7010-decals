# ISO 7010 signs for KSP
## Signs defined in ISO 7010, exported as KSP flags. Meant for use with the Conformal Decals mod.

This is a mod made out of frustration at how low-res the warning decals included with Conformal Decals were. 
SVGs taken from [this Wikipedia article](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_7010).
